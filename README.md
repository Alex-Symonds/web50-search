# Harvard's CS50w: Project 0, "Search", by Alex Symonds

## Introduction
A working replica of Google's main search page, image search page and a portion of the advanced search page. 

## Specification and Provided Materials
Students were given:
* Brass-plate index.html, with a functioning form to perform a normal Google search.

Students were required to:
* Modify index.html to:
    * include links to Image Search and Advanced Search
	* add the "I Feel Lucky" button
    * add other HTML necessary for the desired look
* Create image.html and advanced.html from scratch
* Setup image.html and advanced.html so the various forms perform more specific types of Google searches
* Add CSS to all three pages, matching Google's as much as possible
* Add the Google logo

## Pages
* Index (main search)
* Image search
* Advanced search

## Learning Comments
I was familiar with the basics of HTML and CSS before starting the course, so the main things I learned from this assignment were:
* Use of GET parameters
* Setup and use of SCSS to generate CSS files
* Basic git usage (setting up a repo, commits, push, branches)
* Use of the inspector feature in Chrome
* The existence of the "box-shadow" property
* Use of SVGs for icons
